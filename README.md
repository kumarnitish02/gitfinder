# Git Repository Exposure Scanner

A Python tool to scan websites for exposed `.git` directories and files. This tool helps identify potential security risks by checking for publicly accessible `.git` files, which can leak sensitive information such as source code, configuration, and branch details.

---

## Features
- **Concurrent Scanning**: Uses multi-threading to speed up the scanning process.
- **Regex Matching**: Extracts useful information like branch names and Git configurations.
- **Randomized User-Agent**: Avoids detection by rotating `User-Agent` headers.
- **Progress Bar**: Displays real-time progress during the scan.
- **Output Options**: Saves results to a JSON file for further analysis.
- **Configurable**: Allows customization of delay, workers, and output file via command-line arguments.
